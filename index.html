                    <p>The two days the Reframe team facilitated were just amazing.  Full stop!
                  We heard many comments from people that they couldn't believe it was a pilot.  I think the whole team behind the scenes were especially surprised at how seamless everything came together since we were throwing in slides, videos and taking out handouts right up until the few minutes before the start of the first day!  Your team can roll with change with grace.
                  
                  
                  Each concept built on the last.  Each presenter expertly referred back to material covered previously to tie things together for people.  And your people are just amazing sponges.  It felt to me like they were part of our organization.
                  
                  They were using our cultural language and weaving in important ideas like TYLF regularly (loved that).  Most importantly I think, they did a fantastic job demonstrating their expertise in a fun, accessible and engaging way. Everyone was engaged and valued.</p>
